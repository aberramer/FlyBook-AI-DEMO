✈️ FlyBook AI - DEMO Version
Welcome to the FlyBook AI DEMO repository! This is the demo version of the FlyBook AI project — an intelligent travel assistant that helps users book flights, find hotels, and explore restaurant recommendations through an AI-powered interface.

🔎 This demo focuses only on flight search functionality.
 
 🧠 Project Strategy & Vision
FlyBook AI is designed to:
	•	Bypass limitations of conventional filtering systems on booking websites using web scraping.
	•	Deliver fast, user-focused search results without requiring users to navigate complex UI.
	•	Provide a smooth, integrated experience with AI decision support.
	•	Use real-time scraping agents to access dynamic and filtered flight data.
	•	Offer a simple pay-per-use or package purchase model for scalable usage.

 🧪 What’s in the DEMO?
This repository showcases a simplified version of the FlyBook AI interface:

✔️ Flight Search (active)
❌ Hotel & Restaurant Suggestions (coming in full version)
✔️ Streamlit-based frontend
✔️ Payment integration via Stripe

❗ No use of Bright Data — OpenAI API used for demo purposes
